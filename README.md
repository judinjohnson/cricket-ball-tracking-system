# Project Description
Our project tracks the trajectory of a cricket ball using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system can predict the ballâ€™s path by analyzing video frames and providing real-time feedback to improve cricket officiating and player performance.

# The Problem
Tracking the ball in cricket manually is too slow and prone to human error. In international matches, we have a DRS system. But we miss those technologies in local matches due to a lack of budget. So the players and umpires miss key details during high-speed deliveries.

# The Solution
A deep learning-powered system that tracks the ballâ€™s movement with unparalleled precision, providing data no one ever thought they needed. Even a mobile phone can be used for tracking purpose, so it can be implemented for local matches and also for training purpose.

# Technical Details
**Technologies/Components Used**
